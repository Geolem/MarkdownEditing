# MarkdownEditing 3.0.0 Changelog

Your _MarkdownEditing_ plugin is updated. Enjoy new version. For any type of
feedback you can use [GitHub issues][issues].

This is a major release with several breaking changes, which are required to
fix issues, avoid possible confilcts with other packages and enhance overall
handling of user settings.

If you defined custom key bindings or settings you might need to check those
as command names have changed (prefixed by `mde_`) and all preferences are
moved to _Preferences.sublime-settings_.

  `"setting.auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true`
* hitting `enter` after reference definitions no longer adds duplicates
